# Time-And-Task-Tracking-Application
This application is developed in order to ease the workload for lecturers and students in tracking tasks and time for group assignments. The Responsibility Tracker ensures that lecturers mark every student's work fairly, since it allows them to track the Work Breakdown Agreement of each team and the Time each student spent on their assigned tasks.
